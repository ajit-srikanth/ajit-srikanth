# Ajit Srikanth
I'm a pre-final year (hopefully) Btech + MS by research in Electronics and Communication Engineering student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I'm an undergraduate researcher at Robotics Research Center (RRC) @ IIIT-Hyderabad, advised by Prof K. Madhava Krishna.

This is my new github (from Dec 2024), however I have a small script which has pushed some version of my older projects as well.

###  here from my old github?
well well well, I've been expecting you. Feel free to use those repos, do let me know how you found it ~~stalker~~.

# wait, you wanna know more?
- You can look at my [personal webpage](https://ajit-srikanth.github.io/) (which might still be under construction lol).
- or reach out to me via my [Institute Mail](mailto:ajit.srikanth@research.iiit.ac.in) or [Personal Mail](mailto:ajitsrikanth@gmail.com)
- well if mail isn't your cup of tea, I got a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajitsrikanth/) too.

Its pretty easy to find my other socials as well, most of my usernames are just "ajitsrikanth".
