- You can look at my [personal webpage](https://ajit-srikanth.github.io/) (which might still be under construction lol).
- or reach out to me via my [Institute Mail](mailto:ajit.srikanth@research.iiit.ac.in) or [Personal Mail](mailto:ajitsrikanth@gmail.com)
- if mail isn't your cup of tea, I got a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajitsrikanth/) too.

Its pretty easy to find my other socials as well, most of my usernames are just "ajitsrikanth".
